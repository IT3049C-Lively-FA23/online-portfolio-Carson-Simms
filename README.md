## Self-Reflection:
At first it was a little rough because I had to refresh on HTML syntax and the typical thought process. But after that it wasnt bad. I just took it step by step and made sure I was following the instructions to ensure I completed all the necessary material. I tried to commit my changes often and I tested the code through out development. The longest part of the assignment was messing with the styling. The instructions said to ensure it was equal or better to the given example. So I wasnt entirly sure if what I was doing was enough. But I eventually found something I liked and I felt like it met the requirements. Also, there were few discrepancies between the instructions and the starting files. Little stuff like needing a Pull request on the instructions, but in this README file there is not a section for that. Another possible issue is the links at the top of the README file. I am not sure which ones need changed, and which ones are done already. There are two checkboxes or the assignment checks, but one has the comment "done automatically" and one doesnt. 

### How long it took me to finish this?
2 hours
